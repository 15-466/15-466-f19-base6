		Transform *parent = nullptr;

		//It is often convenient to construct matrices representing this transformation:
		// ..relative to its parent:
		glm::mat4 make_local_to_parent() const;
		glm::mat4 make_parent_to_local() const;
		// ..relative to the world:
		glm::mat4 make_local_to_world() const;
		glm::mat4 make_world_to_local() const;

		//since hierarchy is tracked through pointers, copy-constructing a transform  is not advised:
		Transform(Transform const &) = delete;

	//add transforms/objects/cameras from a scene file to this scene:
	// the 'on_drawable' callback gives your code a chance to look up mesh data and make Drawables:
